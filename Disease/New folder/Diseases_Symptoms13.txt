It is often women who have to bear the pressure of ensuring a successful pregnancy. They're either told to have babies in their 20s or early 30s as they have limited numbers of eggs, which tend to diminish as they get older. But we asked an expert whether it is only women who must adhere to the body's biological clock or if men should also take some measures. Here's what she says.Although it tends to be less pronounced than in women, just like them, men also have a biological clock that can impact fertility, Dr Nivedita Mishra, Fertility Consultant at Nova IVF Fertility East, Ranchi, tells the OnlyMyHealth team.There are many factors that can affect male fertility, some of which include:Sperm quality and quantity: Just like women, men's fertility can decline with age. Older men may produce fewer sperm, and the quality of the sperm may decrease, which can affect fertility.Genetic risks: Advanced paternal age has been associated with an increased risk of certain genetic disorders in children, such as autism, schizophrenia, and Down syndrome. While the overall risk is still relatively low, it's something to consider.Also Read: The Best Age To Get Pregnant: Fertility Expert Shares InsightsHealth conditions: Age can also affect men's overall health, which in turn can impact fertility. Conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension can affect sperm quality and fertility.Lifestyle factors: Smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, drug use, and a poor diet can all negatively impact sperm quality and fertility.Environmental factors: Exposure to toxins, such as pesticides, heavy metals, and certain chemicals, can also affect fertility.  Is There A Best Age For Men To Have Children?  Dr Mishra says, “There isn't necessarily a "best" biological age for men to have children, as fertility can vary greatly from person to person.” However, she highlights that fertility tends to be highest in men in their late teens to early 30s.  Can Ageing Influence The Possibility Of Healthy Pregnancy?  According to the expert, as men age, it can indeed impact the possibility of a healthy pregnancy. In general, ageing can impact fertility in various ways. In fact, a study published in the Upsala Journal of Medical Sciences (UJMS) highlights the challenge of delayed childbearing for fertility. It suggests that the later a woman starts a family, the harder it becomes to conceive naturally.  Fertility rates significantly decline after 30, and miscarriage rates rise with age. Researchers used computer models to estimate ideal family planning ages and shared that women should start trying for children in their early 20s to maximise their chances of achieving their desired family size without needing fertility treatments. However, when it comes to men, while they can technically father children well into old age, the likelihood of conception and the health of the resulting child may be compromised, says Dr Mishra.  Steps Men Can Take   According to Dr. Mishra, there are a few steps men can take to ensure healthy fertility. These include taking the necessary tests to understand their fertility status. Some tests include: Semen analysis: This test evaluates the quantity and quality of sperm in a man's semen. It can help assess fertility and identify any potential issues. Medical history and physical examination: A doctor will review a man's medical history and perform a physical exam to identify any potential underlying health issues that may affect fertility. Hormone testing: Blood tests can assess hormone levels, such as testosterone, which can affect fertility.

They can provide further evaluation and guidance on treatment options, if necessary. “While men's fertility tends to decline with age, it's possible to maintain good reproductive health by adopting healthy habits and seeking fertility experts' advice when needed,” Dr Mishra concludes.Dr Mishra says, “There isn't necessarily a "best" biological age for men to have children, as fertility can vary greatly from person to person.”However, she highlights that fertility tends to be highest in men in their late teens to early 30s.
