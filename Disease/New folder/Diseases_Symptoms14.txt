Infertility can be a challenging journey for couples, and it's essential to address both partners' health to identify any underlying issues. While often the focus is on female fertility, it's crucial to recognise the role of male fertility as well. For men experiencing infertility, a series of tests are available to diagnose potential issues and guide appropriate treatment.We spoke to our expert Dr Shrey Srivastav, General Physician - Sharda hospital to shed some light on the list of necessary fertility tests for men. Here's the comprehensive guide he shared.  1. General Physical Examination and Medical History  A thorough examination of the genitals In-depth discussion about inherited conditions, chronic health problems, illnesses, injuries, surgeries, sexual habits, and sexual development during puberty This helps identify potential factors that could affect fertility.  2. Semen Analysis  Semen sample is analysed in a laboratory Measures sperm count, morphology (shape), motility (movement), and presence of infection Provides valuable insights into sperm quality and quantity.  3. Scrotal Ultrasound  Used to identify abnormalities in the testicles and supporting structures Particularly helpful in diagnosing conditions like varicocele, which can impact fertility.
