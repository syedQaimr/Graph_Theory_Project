Vaginal yeast infections, caused by the overgrowth of Candida albicans fungus, can be uncomfortable and disruptive to daily life. While conventional treatments exist, eating a zinc-rich diet or topical application regularly may offer additional benefits in managing and preventing yeast infections. Let’s explore the role of zinc in treating vaginal yeast infections and its potential benefits for vaginal health.Vaginal yeast infections occur when the natural balance of yeast and bacteria in the vagina is disrupted, according to the Centres of Disease Control and Prevention, leading to symptoms such as itching, burning, discharge, and discomfort during urination or intercourse. Factors like antibiotics, hormonal changes, weakened immune systems, and high sugar intake can contribute to yeast overgrowth.The UK Research & Innovation cited a small study conducted in women dealing with vaginal yeast infection. The results found that 5 out of six women, after applying a zinc-rich topical moisturiser, didn’t experience reinfection. Here’s how a diet rich in zinc can help you fight such infections:   Antifungal Properties: Zinc exhibits antifungal properties that can help inhibit the growth of Candida albicans fungus, the culprit behind most vaginal yeast infections. By targeting the fungus, zinc contributes to the restoration of vaginal flora balance. Immune Support: Zinc plays a vital role in immune function, helping the body combat infections more effectively. A strong immune system is crucial for fighting off yeast overgrowth and preventing recurrent infections. Anti-Inflammatory Effects: Zinc has anti-inflammatory properties that can reduce inflammation and irritation in the vaginal area, providing relief from symptoms like itching and redness associated with yeast infections. Skin Healing: Zinc promotes wound healing and skin regeneration. In cases where vaginal yeast infections cause skin irritation or small tears, zinc can aid in the healing process and soothe discomfort.
