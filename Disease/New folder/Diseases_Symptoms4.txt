Vaginal cancer, while relatively rare compared to other gynaecological cancers, is a serious condition that demands attention. Recognising the early signs and symptoms can lead to earlier diagnosis and better treatment outcomes.We spoke to our expert Dr Aastha Singh, Assistant Professor, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecological Nursing, Sharda School of Nursing Science and Research - Sharda University to shed some light on the early signs of vaginal cancer. Here's what you need to know about identifying the early indicators of vaginal cancer:  1. Abnormal Vaginal Bleeding One of the most common early signs of vaginal cancer is abnormal vaginal bleeding. This can manifest as bleeding between periods, after intercourse, or after menopause. Any unexplained vaginal bleeding should be evaluated promptly by a healthcare professional.  2. Unusual Vaginal Discharge Changes in vaginal discharge, such as abnormal colour, consistency, or odour, can be a sign of vaginal cancer. If you notice persistent alterations in your vaginal discharge, it's essential to seek medical advice for further evaluation.  3. Pelvic Pain or Pressure Persistent pelvic pain or pressure, unrelated to menstruation or other known causes, should raise concerns.

These symptoms may occur if the tumour presses on the bladder or urethra.  6. A Lump or Mass in the Vagina In some cases, vaginal cancer may present as a palpable lump or mass in the vaginal wall.
