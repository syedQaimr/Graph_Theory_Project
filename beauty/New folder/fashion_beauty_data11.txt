Do you often look at your nails and wish you knew a way to fasten their growth? If the answer is yes, you've come to the right place. You can achieve faster nail growth by following various measures, such as combining proper nutrition, hydration, and thoughtful nail care practices. In this article, we list various ways which can help you accelerate nail growth.Maintain a Balanced Diet Good nutrition is the foundation for healthy nails. Ensure your diet includes a variety of vitamins and minerals essential for nail growth, such as biotin, vitamin E, iron, and zinc. Add foods like eggs, nuts, leafy greens, and lean proteins into your meals to provide your nails with the nutrients they need to flourish.  Stay Hydrated Hydration is key to overall health, including the health of your nails. Drinking an adequate amount of water helps prevent dehydration, which can lead to brittle and slow-growing nails. Aim for at least eight glasses of water a day to keep your nails and body well-hydrated.

Use a gentle nail file to shape your nails, and avoid aggressive filing that can weaken them. When trimming, opt for a soft, rounded shape to reduce the risk of snagging and breakage. Additionally, protect your nails by wearing gloves during chores that involve water or harsh chemicals.  Biotin Supplements According to a review conducted by the Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (JDD), ingesting 2.5 mg of biotin daily improves nail health overall and decreases nail breaking. Biotin, also known as vitamin H, is a B vitamin that plays a crucial role in nail health. While biotin is found in various foods, taking a biotin supplement can be a convenient way to ensure you're getting an adequate amount. If you plan on taking supplements, speak with your healthcare professional first. Also Read: Redness And Swelling Due To Ingrown Toenails? Here Are Its Causes And Treatment Measures Regular Moisturising Just like your skin, your nails benefit from regular moisturising. Apply a nourishing cuticle oil or a moisturising hand cream daily to keep your nails hydrated and prevent them from becoming dry and brittle. Healthy, moisturised nails are less prone to breakage and splitting.  Avoid Harsh Nail Products Certain nail products, such as acetone-based nail polish removers and strong adhesives, can be harsh on your nails and hinder their growth. Opt for gentler, acetone-free removers and choose nail polishes that are free from harmful chemicals. Allow your nails to breathe by going polish-free periodically. According to the Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology, regular application of glue-on artificial nails has been shown to weaken natural nails and increase their susceptibility to breaking.   Regular Massages Stimulating blood circulation around your nails is another effective way to promote growth. Gently massage your nail beds in a circular motion for a few minutes each day. This not only encourages blood flow but also helps in the distribution of nutrients to the nail matrix, where new nail cells are formed.  Bottomline By adopting these natural strategies into your routine, you can support your nails in reaching their full potential. Remember, patience is crucial as nail growth is a gradual process, and results may not be immediate.  [Disclaimer: This article contains information for informational purposes only, hence, we advise you to consult your expert if you are dealing with any nail disorder.]Good nutrition is the foundation for healthy nails.
